<h2>SVG Files in CNIT 131A</h2>

<object width="300px" height="300px" type="image/svg+xml" data="svg1.svg"></object>
	
	<p>
	Decided to embed the SVG within an HTML document.
	Why?
	well...keeping it simple always seems best.
	Also, seems as if this method allows for simple,
	yet good control of sizing/scaling.  I also like 
	the separation between specifics of svg and the html.
